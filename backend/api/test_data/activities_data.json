      "description": "Paul Kyle Gallery is proud to present “Duets”, an exhibition of new works from celebrated photographer James O’Mara and the launch of his newly published book of the same title.\n\n\"Duets\" extends beyond mere diptychs, representing a lifetime of visual diaries that have been revisited, reinvented, and reborn. O’Mara’s “Duets” are not just photographs, but rather graphic conversations between times, places, societies. With each pair, he places value on creating compositions that revel in the dialogue of texture, line, and form. This exhibition invites viewers to appreciate the absurd and the orderly, the organic and the constructed, all coming together in a harmonious visual duet. The integration of unrelated images echoes the essence of Rauschenberg's Combine works and his ROCI project, celebrating the unity and dialogue between diverse cultures and people. The creation of “Duets” is a delicate balance of an aesthetic decision. By carefully selecting and combining images, O’Mara emphasizes the importance of difference and context. The resulting pieces are stories told in tandem—a tree's bark mirrored in the stripes of a regal attire, the geometric interplay of concrete architecture with the minimalist purity of white space, and the overlay of vibrant human features with urban decay. O'Mara's \"Duets\" captures the synchronicity of unrelated moments, merging them into a single narrative frame that invites the viewer into a deeper contemplation of space, time, and relationship. Through his lens, the mundane is re-envisioned, granting audiences a transcendent experience that surpasses the confines of conventional photography. This exhibition is a landmark in O'Mara's accomplished career, and a celebration of the essence of life, captured through the lens of a photographer with the soul of a poet. With \"Duets,\" O'Mara crafts a visual lexicon that narrates stories beyond the captured moment, and it invites us to reflect on the interconnectivity of our global community, a poignant reminder of our shared humanity in times where experiences are universally accessible yet deeply personal.\n\nABOUT JAMES O’MARA\n\nJames O’Mara developed his career in the documentary film, editorial and commercial fields, working extensively in fashion, music, portraiture, wine, dance, and travel, with a diverse spectrum of high-profile clients, frequently featured in Rolling Stone, Vogue, the New York Times, GQ, Vanity Fair, and Mojo. His work is consistently recognized and awarded and appears in global publications and advertising campaigns. His photography and graphic design are recognized by the New York Art Director’s, Communication Arts, the Grammy’s, Applied Arts and Graphis. As a photographic artist, he exhibits in Canada, UK, Italy, and China, and is collected internationally. O’Mara’s last publication and exhibition “Encounters” showcased James O'Mara's career spanning fifty years, capturing iconic rock stars and candid moments across his favoured cities. This collection emphasizes the dynamism and ephemeral nature of life through his photographic lens.\n\nFor more information and interviews, please contact the gallery at +1-604-620-0049, or email info@paulkylegallery.com.\n\nGallery Hours: Tuesday to Saturday, 11:30 AM – 5:30 PM or by appointment anytime",

      "description": "The Irish are coming! The Irish are coming! Northern Irish dance-punk trio Two Door Cinema Club have stormed the urban scene with their fresh indie new-wave sound. Think of them as your ticket to catchy dance music without the guilt.\r\n \r\nIf you've been to any cool-kid parties with plenty of PBR or watched a Microsoft Outlook commercial you've heard Two Door Cinema Club. The debut single \"Something Good Can Work\" was originally released in 2009 on a trend-setting compilation from fashion house/record label Maison Kitsunè. If you can't remember it catch it on Youtube (it has nearly 15 million views).\r\n\r\nFollowing in the footsteps of French dance-pop phenomena Phoenix and '80s icon Duran Duran, Two Door Cinema Club recorded their debut 2010 album Tourist History at Eastcote Studios in London. Mixed by Phillip Zdar, his vision was to  punch up the beat with rich bass and foot-stomping rhythm. While on tour with Alt-J, Chvrches, Peace and St Lucia, their live sets turned into impromptu dance parties, not even the most passive fans couldn't resist the groove.\r\nTheir sophomore album Beacon, produced by Jacknife Lee was released in September 2012 and reached No. 17 on the U.S. Billboard 200 with  singles\" Sleep Alone\" and \"Sun.\" Well thought hooks, good beats, and fearless when it comes to having fun, Two Door Cinema Club is going to have many honorary members wanting to join in.",

      "description": "Bombay Bicycle Club have been writing songs for Saturday nights and songs for Sunday mornings since their mid-teens. That they’re now barely in their thirties and remain one of the most inventive, insistent and, arguably, influential British guitar bands of the past generation says much to their powers of reinvention. But it also speaks to the band’s effortless ear for a melody and the masters of its deployment.\r\n\r\nHeading back to the band’s studio in London, Bombay Bicycle Club have lovingly crafted album six – My Big Day. It’s a powerful, expansive body of work, replete with an irrepressible dose of joy too.\r\n\r\nMy Big Day also found the band’s studio door wedged open for a collaborative experience, inviting the likes of Jay Som, Nilüfer Yanya, and Holly Humberstone and Damon Albarn who all feature. There’s a special guest appearance to be revealed later in the year too.\r\n\r\nWhilst the guests came and went as they pleased, the band posited themselves on both sides of the glass for this record, with Jack manning the production chair (save for ‘Heaven’, produced alongside Paul Epworth, and ‘Turn The World On’ with Ben Allen - who they’d previously worked with on ‘Shuffle’).\r\n\r\nOn first listen, Bombay Bicycle Club have opened up the curtains and let this revelatory set of vibrant, joyous compositions bask in the sunshine. It’s an album that means business, sculpted by one of Britain’s best guitar bands. They’ll take it to stages across the world next, and that’s a show you won’t want to miss.",

      "description": "Little Big is a Russian punk-pop rave band that has taken the international music scene by storm with its infectious beats, eccentric visuals, and unique blend of genres. Their music is a fusion of electronic, punk, and pop elements, creating a sound that is both energetic and unpredictable. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Little Big spoke out loudly against the war and was forced to flee their home country and relocate to the US. \r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Big gained widespread recognition with their breakout single \"Everyday I'm Drinking\" in 2014, but it was their 2018 viral hit, \"Skibidi,\" followed by their participation in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 that truly catapulted them onto the global stage. The band's Eurovision entry, \"UNO,\" became an instant hit, showcasing their unapologetically bold style and captivating performances. The accompanying music video, known for its surreal and striking imagery, further solidified Little Big's reputation as a boundary-pushing and visually-driven musical force. It remains the most watched video in Eurovision history with over 280 million views on YouTube. The video for “Skibidi” boasts an even more impressive 715 million views. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat sets Little Big apart is not only their music but also their theatrical and often controversial stage presence. Their live performances are a riot of colors, eccentric costumes, and high-energy choreography, creating an immersive experience for their audience. The band's lyrics often touch on social issues, delivered with a humorous and satirical twist that adds depth to their catchy tunes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond their musical endeavors, Little Big has become a cultural phenomenon, amassing a dedicated fan base around the world. Their influence extends to social media, where their music videos go viral, and their bold fashion choices inspire fans to embrace individuality and creativity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a musical landscape that can sometimes be formulaic, Little Big stands out as a breath of fresh air, pushing boundaries and challenging conventions. With their contagious energy and fearless approach to creativity, Little Big continues to leave an indelible mark on the global music scene, proving that innovation and entertainment can go hand in hand.",

Having been named to nearly every \"Artist to Watch\" list, being crowned Billboard's \"Top New Country Artist of 2021,\" and earning CMT's 2022 \"Breakout Artist of the Year\" honor, the Louisiana native is one of Nashville's hottest and most buzzed-about new artists. Landing her first No. 1 with her PLATINUM Certified ACM Song of the Year \"Things A Man Oughta Know,\" nearly 10 years to the day after leaving her small farming community in a camper trailer to chase her dreams, she has won over legions of fans with her signature Bell Bottom Country sound and aesthetic, which blends traditional Country with a modern yet retro flare. A prolific and sought-after songwriter (having co-writer credits on songs by artists including Luke Combs, Flatland Calvary and more), Lainey is a fresh, fierce voice in Nashville, delivering CMA nominated album of the year with her label debut, Sayin' What I'm Thinkin'. With a rockstar stage presence, her artistry has taken her across the globe, performing for sold-out crowds throughout the US, UK, and Germany with notable names like Jon Pardi, Luke Combs, Morgan Wallen, HARDY, Jason Aldean, Ashley McBryde, and more. After topping the country radio charts for a second time with the two-week No. 1 hit, \"Never Say Never\" with Cole Swindell, her current single \"Heart Like a Truck\" is Top 20 and climbing, with the HARDY collaboration \"wait in the truck\" sitting close behind in the Top 25. Her new album, \"Bell Bottom Country,\" is out now and currently #12 on Billboard's Country Albums chart, and she's soon to make her acting debut on the hit series Yellowstone on Sunday, November 13.",

      "name": "The War on Drugs and The National",
      "description": "The National are probably the biggest band to come out of Cincinnati, Ohio. The indie-rock group is made up of 5 band members, including two sets of brothers, who play alongside lead singer Matt Beringer.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      The band were formed in 1999, and they’ve been touring pretty much ever since. Most of their time as a group has been spent in Brooklyn, New York, where they’ve had a slow burning career that’s seen them grow from being a hardworking but relatively unknown band, to a group who headline festivals around the world and sell out 20,000 capacity arenas.\r\n      The full line up consists of lead vocalist Matt Beringer, twin brothers Aaron (guitar, bass, keys) and Bryce Dessner (guitar), and another set of brothers Scott (bass, guitar) and Bryan Devendorf (drums).\r\n      Matt Beringer’s distinctive baritone voice, alongside his self-penned discerning lyrics gives the band a unique sound, often described as erring on the sombre-side. They are said to have taken influence from the likes of Tom Waits and Nick Cave, but believe strongly in being innovative and continuing to grow independently as an act.\r\n      Interesting fact: one of their biggest breakthrough moments came from their track \"Fake Empire\" featuring on the 2008 Obama campaign. This, alongside successful support tours with artists like R.E.M., set them on the path to their current popularity. The release of \"High Violet\" in 2010 saw them reach the biggest achievements of their career - hitting the top 5 across the UK, US and Canada.\r\n      Their most recent album \"Trouble Will Find Me\", was the record that really cemented them into the mainstream. Just before the release of this sixth EP, they premiered a documentary called \"Mistaken For Strangers\" which followed the band on their \"High Violet\" tour, focusing mainly on the relationship between singer Matt Beringer and his brother, who took on the role of assistant tour manager.\r\n      The National are true strivers, they’ve gradually warmed their way into many a record collection, and with each release prove themselves to be more accomplished than before. Despite their more recent successes, they are not to be considered as having reached a peak: it’s in their nature to continue to improve on themselves.",

      "name": "Chris Brown",
      "description": "Chris Brown is an American R&B pop artist who quickly rose to fame in the mid-2000s after a string of successful singles such as “Run It” and “Yo (Excuse Me Miss)”, followed by his successful self-titled debut album in 2005.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Christopher Maurice Brown was born in Tappahannock, Virginia, on May 5, 1989. His interest and education in music began, like many pop singers, through his involvement in his church choir. During his teenage years, his golden-boy sensibilities waned and his interest in the emerging R&B scene in the US took hold.\r\n      What makes Chris Brown’s music notable is his wide depth of talent. To some, he is a pop music legend, with upbeat tunes and energetic lyrics that make you want to dance. To others, he is an R&B legend, showcasing the soul and heart of his earliest musical influences. He also is known for his slow crooner style of music, which is showcased in songs like “Take You Down” and “Autumn Leaves.” In these songs, Brown demonstrates his ability to convey deep emotions through the slow use of melody and artfully seductive vocals.\r\n      Brown is most renowned for his incredible talent as a rapper. “Look at Me Now,” “Run It!,” and “Go Crazy” all showcase his knack for spitting out lines at wild speeds.\r\n      After moving to New York City, Brown was soon scouted by A&R executive Tina Davis and subsequently signed his first record deal with Jive Records, whose alumni include pop singers Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, in 2004. His debut self-titled album, released the following year, reached No. 2 on the US Billboard charts and was soon certified double platinum.\r\n      The following years were nothing but a string of successes for Brown as he further dominated the charts with pop singles such as “Beautiful People,” “I Can Transform Ya,” and “Yeah x3.” To date, Chris Brown has released a total of twelve albums, with numerous albums winning notable awards.\r\n      One of Brown’s most decorated albums, F.A.M.E., went on to win the Album of the Year Award at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards. Not only that, but shortly after the release of this album, Brown took home the highest number of awards ever given at the 2011 BET Hip Hop Awards. Other notable albums from Chris Brown include Fortune X; Fan of a Fan: The Album; Royalty; Heartbreak on a Full Moon; Indigo; Slime & B; and his latest release Breezy.\r\n      Brown has now certified himself as a staple of American pop and R&B music and remains a continued presence on the charts with both his own material and collaborations with artists such as Jordin Sparks, Lil’ Wayne, and David Guetta.\r\n      Recently, Chris Brown has been on tour with Lil Baby, packing stadiums on their One of Them Ones tour. Together, they take the stage for hours on end, performing their biggest hits. Both his musical talent and his incredibly complex choreographed routines combine to create a memorable event. Now, with Lil Baby sharing the stage, Brown continues to deliver powerful energy during his live concerts.\r\n      Having kicked off the One of Them Ones tour in July 2022, Brown is scheduled to perform with Lil Baby at venues across North America throughout the rest of the year.\r\n      In addition to selling out his own shows over the years, Chris Brown has also taken center stage at countless festivals and events. Recently, he was seen serving up his signature tunes at the Wireless Festival in London. This festival is known as one the largest rap music festivals in the world, attracting talent from around the globe.\r\n      Fans eagerly await the next Chris Brown tour dates, hoping for more shows to be scheduled in cities around the world. Be sure to stay tuned to find out when the latest tour dates are announced.",

      "description": "Mike Rosenberg, known better as Passenger, is a British singer/songwriter quickly impacting the folk-rock scene with his earnest and introspective lyrics. Passenger was formerly a band fronted by Rosenberg that released a number of albums before the band members parted ways. Rosenberg continued with the name, and his latest release, All the Little Lights, is a folk-rock, indie-pop album filled with songs of loss, love, and hope. Critics have praised Rosenberg for his charming and unique voice, poignant yet witty lyrics, and an album that feels fleshed out with additional strings, brass, and restrained percussion. Storming up the Billboard Hot 100, the single “Let Her Go” is a charming, whimsical, and lyrically remorseful song about a relationship in retrospect. Rosenberg supported fellow Englishman Ed Sheeran for most of 2012 before embarking on his first US headlining tour in summer 2013. Concertgoers applaud Rosenberg for his intimate one-man-band shows, raw talent, and charming banter. With tickets selling out for shows across Europe and Australia, fans anticipate an unfaltering music career ahead for this talented singer/songwriter.",

      "name": "Robert Plant & Alison Krauss and JD McPherson",
      "description": "\"These are songs that have gone into our hearts way back in time, but got lost in the twists and curves of the passing years,\" says Robert Plant. \"You hear them and you go 'Man, listen to that song, we got to sing that song!' It's a vacation, really--the perfect place to go that you least expected to find.\"\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Plant and Alison Krauss released Raising Sand, one of the most acclaimed albums of the 21st Century. It was an unlikely, mesmerizing pairing of one of rock's greatest frontmen with one of country music's finest and most honored artists, produced by the legendary T Bone Burnett. It entered the Billboard 200 at Number Two and was certified platinum, and it won six Grammy awards, including both Album and Record of the Year.\r\n\r\nAfter fourteen years, the two icons reunited with Raise the Roof. Earning three 2023 Grammy nominations and unanimous acclaim, these dozen songs have extended this remarkable collaboration in thrilling new directions - from performances on the illustrious stages of Bonnaroo, Forest Hills Stadium, Glastonbury, the Greek Theatre, Red Rocks and far beyond, to appearances on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, CBS Mornings, PBS NewsHour, CMT Crossroads and more, to 2024's Can't Let Go Tour, which will see the duo once again return to North America for nearly 40 dates this spring and summer.\r\n\r\nWith Raise the Roof, Plant and Krauss were determined not to simply replicate a formula. \"We wanted it to move,\" says Krauss. \"We brought other people in, other personalities within the band and coming back together again in the studio brought a new intimacy to the harmonies.\"\r\n\r\nThe duo's intention had always been to continue the momentum of Raising Sand. \"There was so much enthusiasm, excitement and adrenaline that it would have been folly if we didn't keep going,\" says Plant. \"We did join up and consider songs, try to work out some ideas, but then somebody would ask if I'd want to take my band to the Arctic Circle--'OK, I'll do that, call you back, Alison!' And then she goes off and gets another Grammy. We've both constantly made new recordings.\r\n\r\n\"I knew what we could share. In the length of time that I've been making records, this is very rewarding, but a very unusual place to find myself.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, the two singers were stockpiling ideas for songs they might do together, and passing selections back and forth, during the intervening years. \"I've heard Lucinda Williams sing 'Can't Let Go' forever, and I sent that to Robert at least ten years ago,\" says Krauss. \"I remember riding around listening to it and thinking it would be so much fun to do together.\"\r\n\r\nPlant had his eyes on a couple of R&B deep cuts. \"The Betty Harris song 'Trouble With My Lover' was always in the air,\" he says. \"To hear Alison sing that is such a great way of her turning her gift around. And Bobby Moore's 'Searching for My Love' is something I used to sing at school, another nugget of beautiful lost soul music which has been ricocheting between us for a long time.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they were finally able to reconvene in Nashville in late 2019, Plant admits that it was \"kind of daunting.\" After all, when they first met up, there were no expectations; \"When we started, Robert had said that if it didn't work, we'll try it for three days and say goodbye,\" says Krauss. But this time, they not only had to clear the bar of their own magnificent careers, they also had the success of Raising Sand to contend with. Once they got rolling, though, Krauss says the recordings felt \"very natural, very easy--and really fun.\"\r\n\r\nFor his part, Plant wanted to introduce a musical tradition that was part of his own culture. \"I've been a big follower of Bert Jansch's work since I was a teenager,\" he says, \"and of that whole Irish, Scottish, English folk style that has a different lilt and different lyrical perspective. I was very keen to bring some of that into the picture.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of my favorite parts of this is the songs and songwriters that I had never heard of \" says Krauss, noting that in addition to the inclusion of Jansch's \"It Don't Bother Me,\" she feels the \"peak of the record\" comes with \"Go Your Way\" by English folk singer Anne Briggs. \"Working with Robert, and with T Bone, is always a great education in musical history.\"\r\n\r\nThe material on the album encompasses compositions by writers as diverse as Merle Haggard (\"Going Where the Lonely Go\") and the mysterious blueswoman Geeshie Wiley (\"Last Kind Words Blues\")--and even a Plant-Burnett original, \"High and Lonesome\"--in arrangements even more evocative, spare, and hypnotic than those on Raising Sand. In addition to the core band of ace musicians assembled by Burnett, including drummer Jay Bellerose and guitarist Marc Ribot on all tracks, there are appearances from such guests as David Hidalgo from Los Lobos, jazz wizard Bill Frisell, and the eternal Buddy Miller.\r\n\r\nBoth Plant and Krauss point to the recording of \"Quattro (World Drifts In),\" a song by the beloved Americana band Calexico, as a turning point in the Raise the Roof sessions. \"When I heard the song for the first time, it came in the group of songs Robert sent me as possibilities he liked as ideas for us to record,\" says Krauss. \"I thought, 'Oh gosh, here we go'--hearing that song was the moment I knew we'd make another album.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's time to think about walking on the stage again and having that feeling of being just a little bit nervous,\" says Plant. \"And that's really the thing that we both live for--that walk from the side of the stage to the microphone. That's the longest journey, because it lasts a lifetime.\"\r\n\r\nThe accomplishments of Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, of course, are immeasurable. But with Raise the Roof, they take the next step in a project that offers them creative rewards unlike anything else. \"There's so much romance in contrast,\" says Krauss.\r\n\r\n\"It's such a far cry from everything I've done before,\" says Plant. \"I love the whole kaleidoscope of music that I've explored, but this is a place where you can think within the song, you can decide how to bring home an emotion. It's another blend that we've got, and long may we have more of them.\"",

A fan of Jazz from an early age, she went on to attend the University of North Texas, majoring in Jazz Piano and meeting future musical partner, Jesse Harris along the way.\r\n      She soon headed back to New York and was picked up by legendary Jazz Label ‘Blue Note Records’ who released her first album ‘Come Away With Me’ in 2002. It was a huge critical and commercial success, eventually hitting number one in the Billboard Charts before earning Grammy Awards for, amongst others, Album and Record of the year.\r\n      The success of her follow up ‘Feels Like Home’ earned her, not only a place atop the Billboard charts once again, but a spot on Time Magazine’s list of ‘Most Influential People of 2004’. And of course it picked up a few more Grammy awards along the way.\r\n      Her successes continued with the release of each subsequent album, even when she broke from her regular formula such as in the case of ‘…Featuring’, a compilation of numerous collaborations with the likes of the Foo Fighters and Outkast.\r\n      Norah has made a career for herself that carries on the rich musical heritage bestowed upon her from her father and shows no signs of slowing up anytime soon.",
