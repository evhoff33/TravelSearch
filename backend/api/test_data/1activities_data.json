      "name": "The Grand Haveli",
      "description": "The Golden Triangle, (2035 W. Grand Avenue, Chicago, IL) will present THE GRAND HAVELI an installation and sale of Indian architecture, furniture and sculpture opening to the public on June 21 and continuing through September 21, 2024. The event will feature a dazzling collection of antique Indian architectural elements salvaged from 19th century city mansions and aristocratic estates. The pieces will be arranged together to create an immersive exhibit that will transport the visitor to India during the Raj. Featured items include 8 sets of colorful doors, carved wooden columns in various styles and sizes, several elaborate courtyard arches, 3 residential facades, select sculptures, marble planters, furniture and more. It is the largest such exhibition of Indian architecture and antiques ever held in Chicago. The story of the Indian Haveli (mansion) is complex. India is not a mono-culture but a sophisticated tapestry of cultures built on diverse geographic regions, religions, periods of colonization and lucrative foreign trade extending back thousands of years. Accordingly, Indian architecture is a hybrid that defies easy categorization. At the risk of over-simplification, it is built on an ancient indigenous Hindu base that was greatly influenced by Islamic colonization beginning in the 1200’s and then further overlayed with British colonization begun in the 1700’s and extending into the 20th Century. The fact that surviving elements are available at all is a fascinating story. As India’s modern development has accelerated, the urban population of the oldest and wealthiest cities has increased greatly. The old merchant havelis of the 19th Century, were low-rise structures, built around spacious courtyards. As building technology changed (concrete, multi-story, elevators, air-conditioning) the old structures became obsolete. The descendants of the original builders increasingly choose modern habitations, selling the old family structures which are replaced by high-rises. This is of course a trend seen all over the world. The difference is that in India the old parts are meticulously disassembled, photographed, numbered, and saved. Nothing is wasted. Entire facades of historic buildings are now found in vast dealer warehouses, available for sale to collectors around the world. Many boutique hotels, spas and restaurants in Asia now boast these Indian architectural embellishments. Most of the Indian architecture is made from Teak and other domestic woods. Many pieces have a rich patina that has aged beautifully over the decades. The richness of the carving and boldness of their form allows them to blend well in modern interiors. A set of doors becomes the entrance to a wine room. A colonnade frames a library. A lacey façade shields a loggia from the sun, as it did in old Gujarat. The possibilities are only limited by one’s imagination. Best of all, the new owners are preserving the past, honoring the ancient culture if India even if their homes are ultra-modern. A grand party launches the installation before it opens to the public on June 21. High-resolution photography and historical information is available for all pieces upon request. The Golden Triangle is dedicated to blending antiques and modern furnishings and making cultural treasures and natural wonders accessible to the public. The store celebrates its 35th year in April. 10% of any proceeds from the show opening will be donated to LIFT, Leading India’s Future Today, which identifies and develops student leaders in Tamil Nadu.",

It is known for its cheeseburgers, as well as its curse, which is said to have prevented the Chicago Cubs from winning a World Series since 1945.\n\nThe original Billy Goat Tavern was founded in 1934 by Billy Sianis, a Greek immigrant. The tavern was located across from the Chicago Stadium (now the United Center) and attracted mostly sports fans. Sianis became known as \"Billy Goat\" when a goat fell off a passing truck and entered the tavern.\n\nIn 1969, Sianis brought his goat to a Cubs game and was ejected from the stadium for bringing an animal. Sianis then cursed the Cubs, saying they would never win a World Series again.\n\nBilly Goat Tavern has expanded to several locations in Chicago, but the original tavern remains the most popular. The tavern is known for its casual atmosphere and its simple but delicious food. Billy Goat Tavern's cheeseburgers are especially famous, and have been featured in several television shows and movies.\n\nThe Billy Goat Tavern curse is a popular topic of discussion among Chicago sports fans. Some fans believe the curse is real and prevents the Cubs from winning a World Series. Other fans believe the curse is just superstition.\n\nRegardless of whether the curse is real or not, Billy Goat Tavern is an institution in Chicago. It is a popular place for sports fans to gather and watch games, and it is also a great place to enjoy a classic cheeseburger.\n\nFor more information on reservations and prices, consult its official website.",

      "name": "McArthur Binion & Jules Allen: Me and You",
      "description": "GRAY is pleased to announce McArthur Binion & Jules Allen: Me and You, a two-person exhibition featuring eleven new paintings by McArthur Binion and a survey of gelatin silver prints by New York-based photographer Jules Allen. McArthur Binion’s new series of paintings, titled Handmadeness, delve fully into the lexicon of what Binion terms the under conscious: visual markers of his identity collaged in a repeating, interwoven grid. The images in the paintings’ ground layer span a range of sources, from the deeply personal and autobiographical to the public and political. From the former category, Binion uses facsimiles of his birth certificate and his address book, as well as photographs of himself, his hand, and of his father and mother. Discernible segments from a musical score Binion commissioned by the Pulitzer-prize winning composer and saxophonist Henry Threadgill point to the critical role that music and improvisation have played in Binion’s work. Of the latter category is a detail from a photograph published in a 1930s newspaper of a lynching in Marion, Indiana, the dissemination of which confronted the nation with the reality of racial violence. Customary to his practice, Binion obscures the under conscious with washes of ink in novel color combinations and a lattice-like layer in paint stick, the artist’s chosen materials since the 1970s.\n\nMe and You is the gallery’s second exhibition with McArthur Binion and the first show in Chicago to include the work of celebrated New York photographer Jules Allen. Allen studied photography under Jack Welpott, whose formalist leanings were rooted in the tradition of Ansel Adams and Edward Weston, and received a MS in clinical psychology to better understand the human subject. In 1978, Allen moved to New York, where he met Binion among a rich milieu of Black avant-garde musicians and artists. Allen pursued both studio and commercial work for clients including Def Jam Recordings, became a professor at Queensborough Community College, and participated in the Kamoinge Workshop, all as he honed his vision in photographing Black urban life. Me and You surveys Allen’s gelatin silver prints from the 1980s to present, spanning bodies of work including Hats and Hat Nots, In Your Own Sweet Way, and Rhythmology. The photographs reference a lineage that includes Romare Bearden, Henri Cartier Bresson, Robert Frank, Beuford Smith, and Roy DeCarava, with whom Allen also studied. Allen’s keen sense of formal elements such as light, line, and tonality, are used in combination with personal insight and empathy to create a communal portrait across scenes like a street Baptism in Harlem, a woman waiting for the subway, teenagers working out on the street, and a line of police behind a single, elderly protestor.\n\nMe and You commemorates a forty-year dialogue between the two artists, whose mutual admiration originated in the Black avant-garde of 1980s New York City. Absorbing visual, musical, and poetic influences throughout their careers, both artists pair visual clarity and formal rigor with deeply psychological and emotional content.\n\nPUBLICATION:\n\nThe exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue, with a dialogue between McArthur Binion and Jules Allen and an introduction by Dr. Thulani Davis.\n\nABOUT McARTHUR BINION:\n\nMcArthur Binion creates highly personal and labor-intensive works that assert his unique position which fuses the hallmark aesthetics of minimalism and abstraction with the artist’s own emotional content. Binion employs elemental materials including oil-based paint sticks, ink, and graphite to create dense interlacing grids on the surface of his paintings. This, as the artist puts it, “handmade geometry” is applied to a ground layer of neatly tiled images (reproductions of personal photographs and documents) that offer glimpses into his life: his birth certificate from Mississippi, which includes the designation “colored,” a photo of the farmhouse where he was born, a passport-sized self-portrait, a musical score by Henry Threadgill commissioned by Binion, or pages from his address book, which capture formative years in New York among contemporaries including Brice Marden, Dan Flavin, and Jack Whitten. Highly influenced by poetry and bebop jazz, Binion swings between improvisation and order, Abstraction and biography. His works refuse easy categorization, continuously shifting between a critique and an acceptance of the minimalist aesthetic, ultimately rooting the works in a dedication revelatory process of painting itself.\n\nBinion received his Bachelor of Fine Arts from Wayne State University, MI, in 1971 and a Master of Fine Arts from the Cranbrook Academy of Art, MI, in 1973. His work has been featured in major solo and group exhibitions at institutions including the Frist Art Museum,Nashville, TN; Phillips Collection, Washington, DC (2023-24); The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, TX (2024); Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami, FL (2022); Museo Novecento, Florence, Italy (2020–21); Museum of the African Diaspora, San Francisco, CA (2019); Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, MA (2019–21); Smart Museum of Art, University of Chicago, IL (2018); Cranbrook Art Museum, Bloomfield Hills, MI (2018–19); Studio Museum in Harlem, NY (2016–17); and Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, TX (2012), among others. His paintings were featured prominently in the 57th Venice Biennale, VIVA ARTE VIVA (2017).\n\nPublic collections include the Addison Gallery of American Art, Andover, MA; the Art Institute of Chicago, IL; Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art and the Art Bridges Foundation, Bentonville, AR; Cranbrook Art Museum, Bloomfield Hills, MI; Denver Art Museum, CO; Detroit Institute of Art, MI; Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, MA; Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami, FL; Kemper Museum of Art, Kansas City, MO; Morehouse College, Atlanta, GA; New Orleans Museum of Art, LA; Phillips Collection, Washington, DC; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, CA; Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, Washington, DC; and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Studio Museum in Harlem, Metropolitan Museum, and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY, among others.\n\nABOUT JULES ALLEN\n\nJules Allen is an award-winning photographer who creates reality-based images as well as metaphorical documents of which the primary foundation is grounded in behavior, enlightenment, and irony. His photographs express the essential truth that a culture’s power is clearest when presented on its own terms, and, thus, they are evocative of the contemporary American experience. Allen’s images place subjects drawn from the richness of urban black life within universal paradigms.\n\nAllen attended California State University in San Francisco, where he studied photography with Jack Welpott. Jules Allen obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1973 and a Master of Science in Clinical Counseling Psychology in 1975, the latter a conscious choice to facilitate his understanding of human behavior. Moving to New York in 1978, Allen worked as a commercial photographer in editorial, advertising, and entertainment, while actively pursuing the development of a personal vision. His early influences in photography include Edward Weston, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and Robert Frank, as well as Roy DeCarava, his teacher at Hunter College, where Allen obtained a Master of Fine Arts in 1985.\n\nJules Allen has widely exhibited his work in the United States and abroad, and his photographs are held in museum and private collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Studio Museum in Harlem; Brooklyn Museum of Art, New York; Smithsonian American Art Museum and National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York; and others. Allen is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus in the Department of Art and Design at Queensborough College. In collaboration with QCC Art Gallery Press, he has published six books: Black Bodies (2002), Double Up (2011), In Your Own Sweet Way (2013), Marching Bands (2016), Good Looking Out (2020), and The Hats or Hat Nots (2022). He is currently working on a body of work titled Rhythmology.",

      "name": "Michael Charles and His Band",
      "description": "The year was 1984. With a newfound confidence and looking into the future, a young muso from Melbourne Australia decided the time was right to break out on his own and take the solo billing of “Michael Charles”. The next few years were filled with a heavy promotional schedule, writing, recording, touring, honing his style and enjoying the self-expression and the hard work of presenting his own music.In 1989 a turning point in his life and career materialized in the form of an invitation from Mr. Buddy Guy’s management to appear at Buddy Guy’s Legends in Chicago. Without hesitation Michael traveled the 12,500 miles. After the privilege of performing with many more of the blues great in Chicago, Charles returned to Australia. But within days re-boarded the plane with the solid intention of this time staying and growing his career in America. Not too long after landing an opportunity quickly presented itself and MC accepted the honor of joining up with legendary “Fast Fingers”, Jimmy Dawkins and toured the U.S.A for two years.Some thirty years later Michael Charles roots are in America and his career comprises a catalogue of forty releases, his Chicago Blues Hall of Fame induction, and recognition of remaining one of America’s most driven artists as he continues to record and annually tours non-stop across the USA, Canada, and Australia delivering at each stop a precise, energetic, intense, original, guitar driven concert of contemporary blues, “MC style”.Set sail with him from 7pm-9pm Monday June 24, July 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 or August 5 and 12. You won’t want to miss this performance as you take in the phenomenal sun setting across the Chicago Skyline. To purchase tickets, visithttps://tallshipwindy.com/activities/mondaynightblues/",

      "description": "About the EventThroughout the year, the MCA hosts high-quality professional development programming, open to teachers of all subjects, grade levels, and disciplines. These events are educator-specific, skills-based, training on contemporary art integration. Programs are designed in connection with the cultural assets of the MCA and the needs of the Chicago area educators. In keeping with addressing issues of relevance, the 2023-24 Learning Series is a four-part series exploring on “The Impact of Food Apartheid in Education”.The term “apartheid” is used as it acknowledges the existence of economic and racial segregation systems. And as history has shown us, apartheid systems can be dismantled through collective action.In the final Learning Series, join Alexy Irving, Alexandra Antoine, and Taryn Randle as they discuss the importance of garden education in school and out of school. The benefits of having a school garden are insurmountable and very much possible for every school. We’ll discuss how to tie gardening with art, how a successful school garden can lead to healthier eating, mindfulness, entrepreneurship and community togetherness, and we’ll share some hands-on activities you can do with your students.As the culminating session of our four-part series addressing the impact of Food Apartheid in Education, we hope to provide educators with an introduction to some of the numerous ways gardening programs combine arts, civic action, and agriculture in communities across the city.ASL is available upon request.",

      "name": "The Strength It Takes To Be Alone",
      "description": "The Strength it Takes to be Alone is a solo exhibition, featuring Yong Joo Kim, that runs from April 4th, 2024 through May 26th, 2024 in our River North gallery in Chicago.The exhibition extends a heartfelt invitation to those who have experienced the profound struggles of isolation. Showcasing Yong Joo Kim’s sculptural wall installations and wearable art pieces, the work evokes a sense of connection, introspection, and resilience.At the core of Yong Joo Kim’s sculptural art practice lies her unique method of applying pressure and weight to her chosen material. This technique not only captures her personal sense of pressure and burden, but also becomes a transformative method of creation, shaping forms that evoke the innate beauty found in the natural world.With intentional restraint, Yong Joo Kim limits herself to employing hook-and-loop fasteners as her exclusive material. This deliberate constraint challenges her artistic mastery and inspires viewers to discover hidden beauty in the unlikeliest of places.Through this exhibition, Yong Joo Kim invites viewers to reflect on the inherent strength and resilience found within the struggles of isolation. It celebrates the shared human experience of confronting inner challenges and offers a rich tapestry of inspiration, connection, and understanding.

      "description": "CHICAGO – Curious Theatre Branch, continues its 35th anniversary season with a world premiere from Founding Co-Artistic Director Jenny Magnus, The Good, March 29 – April 21, at Chicago Dramatists, 798 N. Aberdeen Street. The Good is a new work created and performed by Magnus and directed with Stefan Brün. The regular performance schedule is Fridays and Saturdays at 8;00 p.m. and Sundays, Feb. 7 and 14 at 3 p.m. The current running time is 50 minutes. Tickets for The Good will be available on Monday, Feb. 12 at CuriousTheatreBranch.com. Tickets are priced on a “pay what you can” scale, with a suggested price of $20. What is good? How are we supposed to be good and interesting? Is the pressure to be good, to be proper, to not hurt others, to not transgress, actually a way to hold one down? Can someone be not good but in tiny ways no one might notice? And what about the word, “virtue”? Loosely dubbing off Marcus Aurelius’ “Meditations,” Jenny Magnus sings her way through this dilemma, as she has been doing for 30 years. She is asking, is not being good the same as being bad? Curious Theatre Branch is dedicated to the creation of new plays and performances and to the production of its annualRhinoceros Theater Festival. Curious aims to promote innovative works of the imagination in the performing arts from a broad and inclusive spectrum of artists and are also devoted to mentoring programs that engage emerging artists as a way to enrich and expand our artistic community. Curious is committed to creating and producing new plays and performances in a collaborative manner, encouraging our members as artists to share decision making and responsibilities, while expanding their skills as writers, actors, designers, directors and arts administrators. Curious also is committed to the idea that a pay what you can pricing policy is sustainable and will suffice over the long term as an economic model.The Good is a solo performance with Jenny Magnus (she/her). The creative team includes Stefan Brün (he/him, director); Jeffrey Bivens (he/him, video); Marlana May Carlson (she/her, stage management); Ralph Loza (they/them, music mixing and mastering, sound consultation) and Julia Rhodes (she/her, movement consultation) and Meghann Wilkinson (she/her, movement consultation).",

      "description": "Opening Passages brings together ten photographic commissions by French and American artists that survey the dynamic social landscapes of Chicago and Paris. The artists presented are Chicago-based artists Marzena Abrahamik, Jonathan Michael Castillo, zakkiyyah najeebah dumas o’neal, Tonika Johnson and Sasha Phyars-Burgess, and Paris-based Gilberto Guiza-Rojas, Karim Kal, Assia Labbas, Marion Poussier, and Rebecca Topakian.This multi-venue exhibition also features site-specific installations in non-traditional venues and community spaces spread across the city, including Experimental Station (Hyde Park), BUILD Chicago (Austin), 6018North (Edgewater), and The Salt Shed (Goose Island). These various activations throughout the city feature work that directly resonates with the neighborhoods where the venues are situated and speak to the socio-cultural themes that structure the overall exhibition, which reflects on urban divisions, cultural identity, immigrant experiences, waterfronts and green spaces, and the built environment. The exhibition centers stories from the margins, forming a visual collage of life within these two global cities.Opening Passages: Artists Respond to Chicago and Paris is part of Art Design Chicago. The exhibition is supported in part by the FACE Foundation, and is curated by Carl Fuldner. Gallery Talk – Wednesday, May 8 from 12-1pm",

Brantley’s work restores innocence to depictions of Black youth, normalizes images of Black children at play, and suggests an entirely new mythology through the creation of Black superheroes. Brantley chats with Amanda Williams, an artist, and 2022 MacArthur Fellow who uses ideas around color and architecture to explore intersections with race. These artists visit the Institute of Design and Chicago Humanities for an upbeat, life-affirming chat about art, representation, and being Black in America.",

Alexander plays Sammy Campo, a staggeringly corrupt, morally bankrupt lawyer who’s threatened with eternal damnation by a terrifying angel after a near-death experience. In a desperate attempt to redeem himself, Sammy forms an unlikely bond with a Catholic priest who is having his own crisis of faith. Filled with razor-sharp wit, this deliciously devious comedy rollicks through the timeless questions of Western philosophy—“morality,” “faith,” and “Are people any damn good?”",

Afterwards, you’ll never look at the built world (or the humble brick) the same way again!Brick of Chicago neighborhood walking tours have been voted one of Chicago’s best tours by Curbed and the Chicago Reader.Old Town is one of Chicago’s most unique neighborhoods, with a blend of Victorian workers cottages, unique midcentury buildings, and massive modern homes. First built up pre-fire by German immigrants, Old Town came to fame in the postwar years as a neighborhood of artists and preservation-minded homeowners – a complicated history that includes the destructive forces of fire and urban renewal, and the creative forces of eccentrics and star-chitects. Join this tour and you’ll never be able to see Old Town, Chicago, or the built world the same way again!After this tour you’ll never look at Chicago or the humble brick in the same way again!",

      "description": "\"entre horizontes: Art and Activism Between Chicago and Puerto Rico\" examines the artistic genealogies and social justice movements that connect Puerto Rico with Chicago. Featuring works by an intergenerational group of artists with ties to Chicago, the exhibition presents Puerto Rican painters who use printmaking techniques and approaches alongside artists who address social and political issues through their work.\n\nThe exhibition also centers Chicago as a city that for decades has championed national conversations on Puerto Rican self-determination and Latine issues, such as immigration and bilingual education. It features a selection of materials documenting the social movements and community organizations that advocated for the rights of underrepresented Latine communities, including historic photographs and other ephemera that tell the story of the anticolonial resistance and transcultural solidarities in the Puerto Rican community in Chicago.",
